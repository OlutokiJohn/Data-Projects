Out of 2224 passengers and crew, 1502 died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage after striking an iceberg. The international society was stunned by this shocking catastrophe, which prompted improved ship safety rules. The lack of lifeboats for the passengers and crew was one of the factors that contributed to the shipwreck's high death toll. Some groups of people had a higher chance of surviving the sinking than others, such as women, children, and the upper class, even though there was some element of luck involved. In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular answer the following question \n\n**Questions to answer include:**\n- Who were the passengers on the Titanic?\n- What deck were the passengers on?\n- Where did the passengers come from?\n- Who was alone and who was with family?\n- What factors helped someone survive the sinking?\n- Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?\n- Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate?\n- What gender had a more survival rate if they had family members and in a particular deck?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pandas import Series, DataFrame\n\n##visualisation libraries\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-23T02:01:43.442685Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-23T02:01:43.443371Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-23T02:01:43.457138Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-23T02:01:43.443247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-23T02:01:43.455068Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading the datasets ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"titanic_df = pd.read_csv('../input/d/johnolutoki/titanic/titanic_data.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-23T02:03:19.640445Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-23T02:03:19.640873Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-23T02:03:19.669988Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-23T02:03:19.640837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-23T02:03:19.669073Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"titanic_df.head() ##print the first 5 rows of the dataframe","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-23T02:03:21.747538Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-23T02:03:21.747915Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-23T02:03:21.772613Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-23T02:03:21.747885Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-23T02:03:21.771824Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"titanic_df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-23T02:03:24.306389Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-23T02:03:24.307161Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-23T02:03:24.354553Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-23T02:03:24.307122Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-23T02:03:24.353360Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The `.describe()` technique offers some fundamental statistical information, and we may also draw some valuable conclusions from it.
